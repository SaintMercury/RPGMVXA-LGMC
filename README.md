## Installation

1. Download and instull ruby onto your machine. If you are using windows, use the provided link below. Make sure to get 2.2.4 for 32-bit systems; DO NOT get a version other than a 2.2.X or x64 bit version. Make sure to add ruby/gem to your system path (should be in the installer).

2. From the same download page as ruby installer, download the dev-kit for the correct version of ruby you have, and follow the instructions using the link provided below.

3. Open a terminal and make sure that ruby has been added to your path by typing "gem -v" into your terminal. You should recieve a version number. Once you are sure, install rvpacker using the provided link below. To verify that rvpacker has install correctly, type rvpacker into your terminal. You should recieve some error message.

4. Install a git client, or learn to use git. The easiest way to do this is to make a github account, and install the github client using the link provided below. Once installed, you will need to clone the repository. Once done, you should be able to start working on the project.

5. Lastly, once the dev tools are all setup, and the repo is cloned, create a new project where the repo is cloned, making sure that all of the repository files are in the project directory. NOTE: RPGMaker often crashes once the project has been made, restart rpgm and it should be fine. You should be ready to work on the game.

Consult the rvpacker github for how you should conduct work. The "Map Landlord" will be Max. Contact him for map assets. DO NOT CREATE NEW MAPS!

Trello is nice site that can allow us to collaborate without actively talking to eachother, look at it here: https://trello.com/

I recommend making an account and playing around with it to see if it's worth our time.
